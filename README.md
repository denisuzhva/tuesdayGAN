# tuesdayGAN
A generative adversarial network that loves sound art.

How to use: uncomment one option in T_launcher.py (train or test the model) and comment the other one, then run $ python T_launcher.py

Dependencies: tensorflow (v1.9 and above works fine), numpy; scipy and matplotlib -- for wav2npy.py

I apologize for the mess! Documentation in progress...
